## Find your team 

You have an idea or a very particular set of skills? Find your team here! 

We will be working with issues to pitch ideas and present individual profiles, so make sure to read up the instructions below! 

### Pitch 

As an individual or a team with an idea, this is how you attract the right folks: 
1. Publish an issue with the template `Pitch` to present your idea and wait for interested people to contact you. 
1. Look for all issues with the tag `Profile` and contact the experts you want on board. 
1. Once you have assembled your dream team, close the issue. 

### Profile 

1. Publish an issue with the template `Profile`. Boast your skills to make sure the right team finds your introduction. 
1. Search the issues with a `Pitch` tag and get in touch with the ideators that resonate with you. 
1. Once you have joined your favourite team, close the issue. 

## Communication 

Of course you are free to use the issue comments. In case you prefer a more private platform, leave your contact information in your `Pitch` or `Profile` so your future team can get in touch.
