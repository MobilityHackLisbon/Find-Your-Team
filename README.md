## Find your team

You have an idea or a very particular set of skills? Find your team here!

We will be working with issues to pitch ideas and present individual profiles, so make sure to read up the instructions below!

### Pitch

As an individual or a team with an idea, this is how you attract the right folks:

1. Publish an issue with the template `Pitch` to present your idea and wait for interested people to contact you.
1. Look for all issues with the tag `Profile` and contact the experts you want on board.
1. Once you assembled your dream team, close the issue.
