## Find your team 

You have an idea or a very particular set of skills? Find your team here! 

We will be working with issues to pitch ideas and present individual profiles, so make sure to read the instructions below.

### Pitch 

As an individual or a team with an idea, this is how you attract the right folks to get started: 
1. Publish an issue with the template `Pitch` to present your idea and wait for interested people to contact you. 
1. Look for all issues with the tag `Profile` and contact the experts you want on board. 
1. Once you have assembled your dream team, close the issue. 

### Profile 

You have expertise to offer and need a team? Here's how to introduce yourself!
1. Publish an issue with the template `Profile`. Talk about yourself and what you can do.
1. Search the issues with a `Pitch` tag and get in touch with the ideators that resonate with you. 
1. Once you have joined your favourite team, close the issue. 

## Communication 

Of course you are free to use the issue comments. In case you prefer a more private platform, leave your contact information in your `Pitch` or `Profile` so your future team can get in touch.
